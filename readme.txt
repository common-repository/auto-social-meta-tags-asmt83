== Description ==

Auto-Social Meta Tags ASMT83 Adds social meta tags automatically on posts, pages and other parts of a WordPress site by using existing characteristics, like the excerpt, tags and featured image.

== How does it work? ==

This plugin adds meta tags to the head of pages and posts.
If the page or post has a featured image, it adds the following tags. If there is not, the tags are not added.
-	LINK image_src
-	META twitter:image
-	META og:image

If the page or post has an excerpt, it adds the following tags. If there is not, it will take the blog's tagline/about.
-	META description
-	META og:description

Using the page's or post's title adds:
-	META og:title

Using the post's tags adds the following. If there are none, the tag is not added. Pages do not have tags.
-	META keywords

To add the type tags it needs a custom option in the post or page that you have to set. If the option is absent, it adds the value 'article'.
-	META og:type
-	META twitter:card

Using the post or page's permalink (URL) adds:
-	META og:url

Using the Facebook App Id introduced here, it adds:
-	META fb:app_id

That's it. It is a short plugin for meta tags, but it does the work.

== Installation ==

Upload the Auto-Social Meta Tags ASMT83 plugin to your blog, activate it, and you're done!
